# Synergistic Volatility Forecasting in Emerging Markets (EGX30)

This repository contains the source code, feature engineering pipelines, and experimental results for the research paper: **"Synergistic Volatility Forecasting in Emerging Markets: Unlocking the Complementarity of News Sentiment and Market Breadth"**.

## Project Overview

This study proposes a **Fusion Model** for predicting volatility shocks in the Egyptian Exchange (EGX30). The methodology demonstrates that combining unstructured data (GDELT-derived News Sentiment) with structural market data (Market Breadth) yields a statistically significant improvement in predictive accuracy over unimodal baselines.

**Key Contribution:** The construction of a "World State Vector" (WSV) utilizing a domain-adaptive lexicon and FinBERT embeddings, fused with aggregated technical breadth indicators via Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to facilitate reproducibility of the experimental pipeline:

* **data/**: Contains the final pre-processed dataset (`processed_features.csv`) used for model training and validation.
* **src/**: Python scripts representing the three stages of the pipeline (Data Collection, Feature Engineering, Modeling).
* **results/**: Output artifacts including LaTeX tables and vector graphics (PDF) generated by the modeling pipeline.

## Dependencies

The project requires Python 3.8+ and the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
To install dependencies:

```bash
